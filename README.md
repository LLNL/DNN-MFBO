# *DNN-MFBO*: Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization via Deep Neural Networks

by Shibo Li, Wei Xing, Mike Kierby and Shandian Zhe

This is the python implementation of the our papr [Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization via Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03117). Bayesian Optimization(BO) is a popular framework to optimize black-box functions. In many applications, the objective function can be evaluated at multiple fidelities to enable a trade-off between the cost and accuracy. We preposed DNN-MFBO that can flexibly capture all kinds of complicated relationships between the fidelities to improve the objective function estimation and hence the optimization performance, please refer our paper for more details

The datasets used of the last two applications in the paper are proprietary datasests, please contact our data provider if you are interested. We attach three well-known sythetic multi-fidelity functions from (https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/index.html)
